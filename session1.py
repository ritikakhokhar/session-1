# write a program to calculate the number if minis in the maxis
#total maxis is 2.5*minis
# 1 minis is 5000
# calculate how much is 4.5 maxis

value for minis is 5000
maxis is 2.5*minis
so 4.5 maxis is equal to 2,5*4.5*minis
display maxis

minis = 5000
maxis = 2.5*minis
print("the value for maxis is: ", 4.5*maxis)
